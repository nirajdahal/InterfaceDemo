Interface

- An interface is a contract. This is what a class will do if a class implements interface
- Instantiating a parent class doesnot make sense in most of the cases. So we use inheritance in order to just give a  contract or map
- If we inherit from a class and interface then the class shuld be mentioned first . ex: public class BatteryPoweredGmeController : GameController,  IBatteryPowered

Pro Tip: Interfaces are contracts. Use them as types when you need common functionality
